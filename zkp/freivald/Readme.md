****Freivald's Algorithm****



***Input*** 

**3 nxn Matrix m1, m2 test and  

**1 nx1 random 0/1 vector 

***Output*** : 

**True if test = m1 x m2 ** 

**False if test /= m1 x m2 **

***About the program***

Haskell Program uses **Data.Matrix** to help with Martrix manipulations

**UnsafeIO and Random** are used for random vector generation

The implementation is still crude (cooked up in 20mins)

Two test scenarious are also included in the code.
Use ghci  to run 
and set the package

```console
:set -package random
```
